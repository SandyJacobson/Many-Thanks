# Project Overview

## Project Name

Many Thanks

## Project Description

In a world where everything a person could want is just a click of a button away, we have become increasingly more entitled. To qoute Veruca Salt, "I want it and I want it now", this mentality is becoming increasingly more relevant with every generation. But do we ever stop to think about the all people who make it happen behind the scenes?

Many Thanks allows a person to take a bird's eye view of their lives and really think about all the people who go unthanked. Whether it is a delivery person, a developer, someone working the checkout line at a grocery store or an individual family member. 

No "thank you" goes unappreciated and it can be as large or small as you want.
