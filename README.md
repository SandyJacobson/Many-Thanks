# Project Overview

## Project Name

Many Thanks

## Project Description

In world where everything a person could want is just a click of a button away, we have become increasingly more entitled. To qoute Veruca Salt, "I want it and I want it now", this mentality is becoming increasingly more relevant with every generation. But do we ever stop to think about the all people who make it happen behind the scenes?

Many Thanks allows a person to take a birds eye of view of their lives and really think about all the people who go unthanked. Whether it is a delivery person, a developer, someone working the checkout line at a grocery or an individual family member. 

No "thank you" goes unappreciated and it can be a large or small as you want.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
