# Project Overview

## Project Name

Many Thanks

## Project Description

In world where everything a person could want is just a click of a button away, we have become increasingly more entitled. To qoute Veruca Salt, "I want it and I want it now", this mentality is becoming increasingly more relevant with every generation. But do we ever stop to think about the all people who make it happen behind the scenes?

Many Thanks allows a person to take a birds eye of view of their lives and really think about all the people who go unthanked. Whether it is a delivery person, a developer, someone working the checkout line at a grocery or an individual family member. 

No "thank you" goes unappreciated and it can be a large or small as you want.

## Swot Analysis

I feel like I don't know React enough to build this. I know there is support and I plan to use it, but my biggest obstacle I believe is my lack of knowledge, confidence. Everytime it seemed like I was getting a handle on concept, we would introduce something else and would throw everything else off. I believe I'm at a good starting point, I know what I don't know. But I also think it's a lot. 

I know that I need to just get working and deal with issues as they come along.
