      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        In world where everything a person could want is just a click of a
        button away, we have become increasingly more entitled. To qoute Veruca
        Salt, "I want it, and I want it now", this mentality is becoming
        increasingly more relevant with every generation. But do we ever stop to
        think about the all people who make it happen behind the scenes? Many
        Thanks allows a person to take a birds eye of view of their lives and
        really think about all the people who go unthanked. Whether it is a
        delivery person, a developer, someone working the checkout line at a
        grocery store or an individual family member. No "thank you" goes
        unappreciated and it can be as large or small as you want.
